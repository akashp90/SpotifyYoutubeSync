# SpotifyYoutubeSync

## Will be available at https://youtubespotifysync.com


App is still in development, and as you can see, I am not a front-end expert. 

A web app which syncs a user's Youtube playlist with their spotify playlist. 

Used to exclusively listen to music on YouTube before moving to Spotify? 
Then you must have a lot of painfully curated playlists on YouTube which you want to access on your Spotify app. 
With this app, you now can! 
Work in progress! 

Note: I've temporarily shut down the ECS service, cluster and EC2 instance to save costs while the application is under development
