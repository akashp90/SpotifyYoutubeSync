# SpotifyYoutubeSync

## Now available at https://youtubespotifysync.com


App is still in development, and as you can see, I am not a front-end expert. 

A web app which syncs a user's Youtube playlist with their spotify playlist. 

Used to exclusively listen to music on YouTube before moving to Spotify? 
Then you must have a lot of painfully curated playlists on YouTube which you want to access on your Spotify app. 
With this app, you now can! 
Work in progress!
